Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Python)

Introduction:

Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction project using Machine Learning in Python! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems, particularly in the domain of real estate.

Project Overview:

This project begins with a scenario presented by the CEO of a real estate company, outlining their problem and the need for a predictive model to assist in pricing properties. We walk through the entire process, from data collection to model deployment, using Jupyter notebooks.

Project Structure:

Data Collection: We gather relevant data necessary for the analysis and prediction task.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We explore the data to gain insights, identify patterns, and understand relationships between variables.
Model Development: Using machine learning algorithms, we build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features.
Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.
Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, we deploy it for practical use by the real estate company.

Key Concepts Covered:

Cross-validation,
Train-test splitting,
Stratified shuffle split,
Handling missing values,
Feature selection,
Model evaluation metrics
